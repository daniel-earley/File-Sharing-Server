# File Sharing Server #

Made by Daniel Earley for CSCI 2040 Assignment 2.

### Project Information ###
This project uses sockets and multithreading to create a file sharing 
application. The application allows the user to upload and download files from 
a user-specified location. On the left side of the application is the client's 
(user's) shared folder, this folder holds a list of files that they may upload 
to the server. The right side of the application shows the files stored on the 
server. Above the file lists are 4 buttons; Upload, Download, Upload All and 
Download All. The Upload button will upload only the selected file whereas the 
Upload All button will upload all files in the shared folder. Likewise, the 
Download button will download only the selected file from the server, and the 
Download All button will download all files from the server. An image of the UI 
is below. ![Alt text](./resources/Running%20Application.png).

#### TL:DR #### 
File Sharing Server: User selects a shared folder and can upload files from the 
folder to the server, or download files from the server to the shared folder.
